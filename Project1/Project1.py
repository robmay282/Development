Project Description: Website Sign-Up
In this project, you will write a program that prompts a user to sign up for a website. The user must come up with a username and password, then log in using the username and password.
There are requirements for both the username and password. If either one doesnâ€™t meet the requirements, print an appropriate error message and ask the username for a new username and password.
If they are both valid, store them as variables. Then ask the user to log in using the username and password they chose.
'''
# Print statement to inform the user of the username & password requirements.

print("You must follow these requirements when creating your account. \n"
                     "USERNAME REQUIREMENTS: \n"
                     "-Must start with a lowercase letter. \n" 
                     "-Only contain letters, numbers and underscores. \n\n" 
                     
                     "PASSWORD REQUIREMENTS:\n"
                     "-Contain at least 8 characters.\n"
                     "-Contain at least one uppercase letter.\n"
                    "-Contain at least one lowercase letter.\n"
                     "-Contain at least one digit.\n"
                     "-Contain at least one of these characters: !, ?, @, #, $, ^, &, *, _, -, \n"
                     "-Doesn't contain any spaces")
