1. Use built in print function to display strings

2. create snake-cased descriptive variable names

3. Use arithmetic operators

4. calculate based on an equation that utilizes pemdas

5. Identify datatypes (bool, Int, Float, Strings) with type function

6. Shortcut operators

7. Boolean operators

8. Strings

9. User Input & misc

10. Conditionals

'''

1. Use built in print function to display strings

'''

 

# Print Hello World
#print('Hello World')
 

# Print What a wonderful day
#print('What a wonderful day')
 

# Print Today is Wednesday
#print('Today is Wednesday')
 

# Print Onward and upward
#print('Onward and upward')
 

# Print This year really flew by
#print('This year really flew by')
 

'''

2. create snake-cased descriptive variable names, than print # lower case separted by underscore.

'''

 

# car color equal to blue
# car_color = 'blue'
# print(car_color)
 

# favorite ice cream equal to strawberry
# fav_ice_cream = 'strawberry'
# print(fav_ice_cream)
 

# first name equal to your first name
# first_name = 'Robin'
# print(first_name)
 

# system password equal to nevada12
# system_password = "nevada12"
# print(system_password)
 

# favorite food equal to pizza
# fav_food = 'pizza'
# print(fav_food)
 

'''

3. Use arithmetic operators (PEMDAS) What does PEMDAS stand for? Parenthesis, exponents,

multiply, divide, add subtract. please excuse my dear aunt sally

'''

 

# In a variable called 'result' solve (2 + 5) * 6, than print.
# var_result = (2 + 5) * 6
# print(var_result)

 

# In the variable called 'answer' solve 5 + 4 * 3, than print
# var_answer = 5 + 4 * 3
# print(var_answer)

 

# in a variable called birth year, assign your year of birth. In a variable called current year,
# var_birth_year = 1976
# var_current_year = 2023
# var_age_in_a_decade = var_current_year - var_birth_year + 10
# print(var_age_in_a_decade)

# assign the current year.  create a variable for 'age  in a decade'  which subtracts your birth

# year from the current year, and adds ten, print the result

 

'''

4. calculate based on an equation that utilizes pemdas, utlize f strings to display good output

for the user

 

'''

 

# Circumference of a circle,  C=2Ï€r, lets import the math module and try something new,
# print(math.pi)

# # math.pi for pi, solve for radius being 3, than print
# radius = 3
# circumference_of_a_circle = 2 * math.pi * radius
# print(f'The circumference of the cirecle with a radius of {radius} is
# {circumference_of_a_circle: .2f}')
 

# average of 3 test scores (95, 82, 90), the old-fashioned way so we can manually utilize PEMDAS
# test_1 = 95
# test_2 = 82
# test_3 = 90

# test_average = (test_1 + test_2 + test_3)/3
# print('Congratulation, your test score is')test_average
# use variables for every value, than print

 

'''

5. Identify datatypes (bool, Int, Float, Strings) - type function

'''

 

# dog_name = 'fido'
# print(type(dog_name))

 

# age = 27
# print(type(age))

 

# weather_is_hot = True
# print(type(weather_is_hot)
 
# average_weight = 165.23
# print(type(average_weight)
 

last_name = 'jenkins'

 

phrase_of_the_week = 'I love coding!'

 

is_logged_in = False

 

temp_f = 74

 

scores = [75, 45, 23, 99]

 
my_vals = {'heart', 12, 'mazda', 'springtime'}

 

# my_dog = {

#     "size":"small",

#     "appetite": "big"

# }

 

'''

6. Shortcut operators

'''

 

# num_one is assigned value of 6, using shortcut operator, subtract 3
# num_one = 6
# num_one = 3 # subtracting 3
# num_one = num_one - 3
# print(num_one)
 

# # num_two is assigned value of 10, using shortcut operator, add 2
# num_two = 10
# num_two += 2
# print(num_two)
 

# # num_three is assigned value of 12, using shortcut operator, divide by 2.5
# num_three =12
# num_three /= 2.5
# print(num_three)
 

# # num_four is assigned value of 3, using shortcut operator, add 12
# num_four = 3
# num_four += 2
# print(num_four)
 

# # num_five is assigned value of 8, using shortcut operator, multiply 2
# result = 5 < 7
# print(f'Is 5 less than 7? {result}')
 

'''

7. Boolean operators - Print results

'''

 

# Is 5 is less than 7?

 

# Is 16 divided by 2 equal to 8?

 

# Is 12 greater than 19?
# result = 12 > 19
# print(f'Is 12 greater than 19? {result}')
 

# Variable ice_cream_tasty is set to True. Apply 'not' and print the new result
# ice_cream_tasty = True
# print(not ice_cream_tasty)
 

# Set the variable food to spaghetti. Using the boolean operator 'in', is there a letter g in
# food ='spaghetti'
# print('g' in food)
# # spaghetti? Is there a letter z in spaghetti?
# print('z' in food)
 

# Is the string dog not equal to cat?
# print('dog' == 'cat')
 

'''

8. Strings

'''

# assign your first name to a variable, assign your last name to a variable, concatenate them to
# var_fname = 'Robin'
# var_lname = 'Maynard'
# var_fullname = var_fname + ' ' + var_lname
# print(var_fullname)
# a new variable called full_name, include an additional string for the space in between

 

# Store the string 'Saturday' in a variable called, 'day'. Multiply it so that appears 4 times in
# a new variable
# day = 'saturday'
# fav_day = day * 4
# print(fav_day)



 

# # store the length of the string 'peanut butter" in variable my_food
# var_my_food = len('peanut butter')
# my_food_length = len(var_my_food)
# print(f'The length of my {var_my_food} is {my_food_length}')
# # print(var_my_food)
 

# store the length of the string 'coffee' in variable my_drink
# var_my_drink = len('coffee')
# print(var_my_drink)

# user_age = int(input('what is your age? ')   # int(casts input result to integer)
# print(type(user_age))

# print the values 1 through 5 and separate each number with an asterisk, using sep parameter

print("Lets", end="\t")    # escape characters \t, \n
print("Party")

# Two print statements, "Lets" and "Party", use the end parameter to create a space between the

# two. Test the newline and tab escape characters with these print statements

 

'''

Conditionals

'''

 

# If the variable myname is equal to the string version of your first name, let's print,
