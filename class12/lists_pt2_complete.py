How do you access each element in this list by index?
my_list = ["hello", 1, ["dog", 3], "cat", [True, ["frog", 5]]]
For example, "hello" is my_list[0]. How do you access all the other elements?

'''

my_list = ["hello", 1, ["dog", 3], "cat",[True, ["frog", 5]]]

# Access each list item in the print statements below

# print(my_list[0]) # hello

# print(my_list[1])  # 1
# print(my_list[2][0])  # dog
# print(my_list[2][1])  # 3
# print(my_list[3])  # cat
# print(my_list[4][0])  # True
# print(my_list[4][1][0])  # frog
# print(my_list[4][1][1])  # 5

# Use cases -  animation, 3d modeling, complex math

''' 2D Lists'''

'''
Exercise
Write a 2D list that is a 3x3 grid of numbers.
Write some code that prints out that grid nicely with proper formatting.
Example:
lis = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
'''

# lis = [
#     [1,2,3],
#     [4,5,6],
#     [7,8,9]
#     ]

# for rows in lis: # looping through our rows
#     for columns in rows:
#         print(columns, end= ' ')
#     print() # get our returns for formatting


    

'''
Write some code that goes through a 2D list and prints the columns.
Example:
lis = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
1 4 7
2 5 8
3 6 9
Hint: First create a new 2D list with swapped rows and columns. (You will need 2 nested for loops.) Then it's the same as the last problem.
'''

lis = [
    [1,2,3],
    [4,5,6],
    [7,8,9]
    ]

final_list =[] # this will hold our swapped columns

for i in range(len(lis[0])): # this will get the length of our 2d lists, set stop parameter
    temp_list = [] # this list will place our column items
    for item in lis:
        # appending list values and indexes
        temp_list.append(item[i])
    final_list.append(temp_list) # rows and columns have swapped

# for row in final_list:
#     for columns in row:
#         print(columns, end=' ')
#     print()

# numbers = [5, 10, 15]
# print(sum(numbers))


'''
You are given a 2D list representing a table of data with rows and columns. Write a Python program to calculate the sum and average of each column in the table.
For example, if this is your list:
data = [[45,56,89],[67,34,78],[23,67,34]]
This would be your output:
Column 1: Sum = 135, Average = 45.0
Column 2: Sum = 157, Average = 52.33
Column 3: Sum = 201, Average = 67.0
Hint: Make a list to store the sums, and a list to store the averages.
