'''Robin Maynard
Assignment 4: Part 1 - Write a while loop that will output a count from 0 to 100, with increments of 5.'''

# Step 1 - I'm setting variables for the starting number and ending number as integers.

# starting_num = 0
# ending_num = 100


# Step 2 - while loop

# while starting_num < ending_num:
#     starting_num += 5
#     print(starting_num)



'''Assignment 4: Part 2 - Write a for loop that will loop through the string,
"She sells seashells by the seashore" and 
will count every instance of the letter s, regardless of case.'''

# # Step 1 - Here I'm setting my string variable.

# my_string = 'She sells seashells by the seashore'
# s = 0

# # Step 2 - For loop - Here I am adding counting letters 's' and 'S' in my string and adding them to get the total count of letter s regardless of case.

# for s in my_string:
#     total_s_count = my_string.count('s') + my_string.count('S')
# print(total_s_count)
